# Simple To-Do application on MERN Web Stack

### MERN STACK
MERN stack is one of the widely used web development technology stacks in use today. The technology stack is a set of frameworks and tools used to develop a software product. They are very specifically chosen to work together in creating a well-functioning software.

- MERN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS)
- LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) 
- MEAN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS, NodeJS)

### What is MERN stack?
MERN stack is a web development framework. It is made up of four key technologies as its working components: 
- MongoDB - document database. It is a document-based, open source and a no-SQL database used to store the application data 
- Express(.js) - Node.js web framework. A web application and server side framework for Node.js. A framework on the other side is a compilation of code libraries that a developer can use to speed up development work, rather than writing code completely from scratch.
- React(.js) - a client-side JavaScript framework. A javascript front-end library for building user interfaces.
- Node(.js) - the premier JavaScript web server. Javascript run-time environment that executes javascript code outside of a browser (such as a server, machine).

In MERN stack, every line of code is written in JavaScript. This is a programming language that’s used everywhere, both for client-side code and server-side code. With one language across tiers, there’s no need for context switching.

For tech stack with multiple programming languages, developers have to figure out how to interface them together. With the JavaScript stack, developers only need to be proficient in JavaScript and JSON. Overall, using the MERN stack enables developers to build highly efficient web applications.

MERN is a full-stack architecture, following the traditional 3-tier architectural pattern, including the front-end display tier (React.js), application tier (Express.js and Node.js), and database tier (MongoDB). It allows an easy construction of  a 3-tier architecture (frontend, backend, database) entirely using JavaScript and JSON.

As shown on the illustration above, a user interacts with the ReactJS UI components at the application front-end residing in the browser. This frontend is served by the application backend residing in a server, through ExpressJS running on top of NodeJS.

Any interaction that causes a data change request is sent to the NodeJS based Express server, which grabs data from the MongoDB database if required, and returns the data to the frontend of the application, which is then presented to the user.

In order to complete this project you will need an AWS account and a virtual server with Ubuntu Server OS.

If you do not have an AWS account - go back to [WEB STACK IMPLEMENTATION](https://github.com/samuelbartels20/web-stack-implementation) Step 0 to sign in to AWS free tier account and create a new EC2 Instance of t2.nano family with Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS (HVM) image. Remember, you can have multiple EC2 instances, but make sure you **STOP** the ones you are not working with at the moment to save available free hours.

**Hint #1**: When you create your EC2 Instances, you can add Tag “Name” to it with a value that corresponds to a current project you are working on - it will be reflected in the name of the EC2 Instance. Like this:

[MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download.html) is an advanced multirotocol and multitool terminal for Windows.

Download and launch MobaxTerm, create a new SSH session with , ‘ubuntu’ as username and your private key (.pem file) like this:

To deploy a simple To-Do application that creates To-Do lists like this:

![](./images/mern.gif)

##  Backend configuration
Update ubuntu

```
sudo apt update
```
![](./images/ec2.png)

![](./images/update.png)

Upgrade ubuntu
```
sudo apt upgrade
```
![](./images/upgrade.png)

Lets get the location of Node.js software from [Ubuntu repositories](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions#deb).

```
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x | sudo -E bash -
```

![](./images/side.png)

### Install Node.js on the server
Install Node.js with the command below
```
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```
![](./images/node.png)

**Note**: The command above installs both <span style="color:red">nodejs</span>. and <span style="color:red">npm</span>. [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) is a package manager for Node like <span style="color:red">apt</span> for Ubuntu, it is used to install Node modules & packages and to manage dependency conflicts.

Verify the node installation with the command below
```
node -v 
```
![](./images/version.png)

Verify the node installation with the command below
```
npm -v 
```
![](./images/n-version.png)

### Application Code Setup
Create a new directory for your To-Do project:
```
$ mkdir Todo
```

Run the command below to verify that the <span style="color:red">Todo</span> directory is created with <span style="color:red">ls</span> command

**TIP**: In order to see some more useful information about files and directories, you can use following combination of keys <span style="color:red">ls -lih</span> - it will show you different properties and size in human readable format. You can learn more about different useful keys for <span style="color:red">ls </span> command with <span style="color:red">ls --help</span>.

Now change your current directory to the newly created one:
```
$ cd Todo
```

Next, you will use the command <span style="color:red">npm init</span> to initialise your project, so that a new file named <span style="color:red">package.json</span> will be created. This file will normally contain information about your application and the dependencies that it needs to run. Follow the prompts after running the command. You can press <span style="color:red">Enter</span> several times to accept default values, then accept to write out the <span style="color:red">package.json</span> file by typing <span style="color:red">yes</span>.

![](./images/npm.png)

Run the command <span style="color:red">ls</span> to confirm that you have package.json file created.

![](./images/ls.png)

### Install ExpressJS
Remember that Express is a framework for Node.js, therefore a lot of things developers would have programmed is already taken care of out of the box. Therefore it simplifies development, and abstracts a lot of low level details. For example, Express helps to define routes of your application based on HTTP methods and URLs.

To use express, install it using npm:
```
$ npm install express
```
![](./images/crop.png)

Now create a file <span style="color:red">index.js</span> with the command below
```
$ touch index.js
```
Run <span style="color:red">ls</span> to confirm that your index.js file is successfully created

Install the <span style="color:red">dotenv</span> module
```
npm install dotenv
```

Open the index.js file with the command below
```
$ vim index.js
```

Type the code below into it and save. Do not get overwhelmed by the code you see. For now, simply paste the code into the file.
```
const express = require('express');
require('dotenv').config();

const app = express();

const port = process.env.PORT || 5000;

app.use((req, res, next) => {
res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "\*");
res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Headers", "Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept");
next();
});

app.use((req, res, next) => {
res.send('Welcome to Express');
});

app.listen(port, () => {
console.log(`Server running on port ${port}`)
});
```

![](./images/code.png)

Notice that we have specified to use port <span style="color:red">5000</span> in the code. This will be required later when we go on the browser.

Use <span style="color:red">:w</span> to save in vim and use <span style="color:red">:qa</span> to exit vim

Now it is time to start our server to see if it works. Open your terminal in the same directory as your index.js file and type:
```
$ node index.js
```

If every thing goes well, you should see **Server running on port 5000** in your terminal.

![](./images/cli.png)

Now we need to open this port in EC2 Security Groups. Refer to [WEB STACK IMPLEMENTATION](https://github.com/samuelbartels20/web-stack-implementation) Step 1 – Installing the Nginx Web Server. There we created an inbound rule to open TCP port 80, you need to do the same for port 5000, like this:

![](./images/codr.png)

Open up your browser and try to access your server’s Public IP or Public DNS name followed by port 5000:
```
http://<PublicIP-or-PublicDNS>:5000
```

Quick reminder how to get your server’s Public IP and public DNS name:
- You can find it in your AWS web console in EC2 details
- Run <span style="color:red">curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-ipv4</span> for Public IP address or <span style="color:red">curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-hostname</span> for Public DNS name.

### Routes
There are three actions that our To-Do application needs to be able to do:
- Create a new task
- Display list of all tasks
- Delete a completed task

Each task will be associated with some particular endpoint and will use different standard [HTTP request methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods): POST, GET, DELETE.

For each task, we need to create <span style="color:red">routes</span> that will define various endpoints that the <span style="color:red">To-do</span> app will depend on. So let us create a folder <span style="color:red">routes</span>
```
$ mkdir routes
```

**Tip**: You can open multiple shells in Putty or Linux/Mac to connect to the same EC2

Change directory to <span style="color:red">routes</span> folder.
```
$ cd routes
```

Now, create a file <span style="color:red">api.js</span> with the command below
```
touch api.js
```

Open the file with the command below
```
vim api.js
```

Copy below code in the file. (Do not be overwhelmed with the code)
```
const express = require ('express');
const router = express.Router();

router.get('/todos', (req, res, next) => {

});

router.post('/todos', (req, res, next) => {

});

router.delete('/todos/:id', (req, res, next) => {

})

module.exports = router;
```

### Models
Now comes the interesting part, since the app is going to make use of [Mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/) which is a NoSQL database, we need to create a model.

A model is at the heart of JavaScript based applications, and it is what makes it interactive.

We will also use models to define the database schema . This is important so that we will be able to define the fields stored in each Mongodb document. ***(Seems like a lot of information, but not to worry, everything will become clear to you over time. I promise!!!)***

In essence, the Schema is a blueprint of how the database will be constructed, including other data fields that may not be required to be stored in the database. These are known as virtual properties

To create a Schema and a model, install [mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) which is a Node.js package that makes working with mongodb easier.

Change directory back Todo folder with <span style="color:red">cd ..</span> and install Mongoose
```
$ npm install mongoose
```

Create a new folder with <span style="color:red">mkdir models</span> command

Change directory into the newly created ‘models’ folder with <span style="color:red">cd models</span> .

Inside the models folder, create a file and name it <span style="color:red">todo.js</span> 
```
touch todo.js
```

**Tip**: All three commands above can be defined in one line to be executed consequently with help of <span style="color:red">&&</span>  operator, like this:
```
mkdir models && cd models && touch todo.js
```

Open the file created with vim todo.js then paste the code below in the file:
```
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const Schema = mongoose.Schema;

//create schema for todo
const TodoSchema = new Schema({
action: {
type: String,
required: [true, 'The todo text field is required']
}
})

//create model for todo
const Todo = mongoose.model('todo', TodoSchema);

module.exports = Todo;
```
![](./images/imp.png)

Now we need to update our routes from the file <span style="color:red">api.js</span> in ‘routes’ directory to make use of the new model.

In Routes directory, open api.js with <span style="color:red">vim api.js</span>, delete the code inside with :%d command and paste there code below into it then save and exit
```
const express = require ('express');
const router = express.Router();
const Todo = require('../models/todo');

router.get('/todos', (req, res, next) => {

//this will return all the data, exposing only the id and action field to the client
Todo.find({}, 'action')
.then(data => res.json(data))
.catch(next)
});

router.post('/todos', (req, res, next) => {
if(req.body.action){
Todo.create(req.body)
.then(data => res.json(data))
.catch(next)
}else {
res.json({
error: "The input field is empty"
})
}
});

router.delete('/todos/:id', (req, res, next) => {
Todo.findOneAndDelete({"_id": req.params.id})
.then(data => res.json(data))
.catch(next)
})

module.exports = router;
```

### MongoDB Database
We need a database where we will store our data. For this we will make use of mLab. mLab provides MongoDB database as a service solution ([DBaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_database)), so to make life easy, you will need to sign up for a shared clusters free account, which is ideal for our use case. [Sign up here](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas-signup-from-mlab). Follow the sign up process, select **AWS as the cloud provider, and choose a region near you.
