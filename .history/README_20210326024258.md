# Simple To-Do application on MERN Web Stack

### MERN STACK
MERN stack is one of the widely used web development technology stacks in use today. The technology stack is a set of frameworks and tools used to develop a software product. They are very specifically chosen to work together in creating a well-functioning software.

- MERN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS)
- LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) 
- MEAN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS, NodeJS)

### What is MERN stack?
MERN stack is a web development framework. It is made up of four key technologies as its working components: 
- MongoDB - document database. It is a document-based, open source and a no-SQL database used to store the application data 
- Express(.js) - Node.js web framework. A web application and server side framework for Node.js. A framework on the other side is a compilation of code libraries that a developer can use to speed up development work, rather than writing code completely from scratch.
- React(.js) - a client-side JavaScript framework. A javascript front-end library for building user interfaces.
- Node(.js) - the premier JavaScript web server. Javascript run-time environment that executes javascript code outside of a browser (such as a server, machine).

In MERN stack, every line of code is written in JavaScript. This is a programming language that’s used everywhere, both for client-side code and server-side code. With one language across tiers, there’s no need for context switching.

For tech stack with multiple programming languages, developers have to figure out how to interface them together. With the JavaScript stack, developers only need to be proficient in JavaScript and JSON. Overall, using the MERN stack enables developers to build highly efficient web applications.

MERN is a full-stack architecture, following the traditional 3-tier architectural pattern, including the front-end display tier (React.js), application tier (Express.js and Node.js), and database tier (MongoDB). It allows an easy construction of  a 3-tier architecture (frontend, backend, database) entirely using JavaScript and JSON.
