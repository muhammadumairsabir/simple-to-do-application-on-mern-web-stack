# Simple To-Do application on MERN Web Stack

### MERN STACK
MERN stack is one of the widely used web development technology stacks in use today. The technology stack is a set of frameworks and tools used to develop a software product. They are very specifically chosen to work together in creating a well-functioning software.

- MERN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS)
- LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) 
- MEAN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS, NodeJS)

### What is MERN stack?
MERN stack is a web development framework. It is made up of four key technologies as its working components: 
- MongoDB - document database. It is a document-based, open source and a no-SQL database used to store the application data 
- Express(.js) - Node.js web framework. A web application and server side framework for Node.js. A framework on the other side is a compilation of code libraries that a developer can use to speed up development work, rather than writing code completely from scratch.
- React(.js) - a client-side JavaScript framework. A javascript front-end library for building user interfaces.
- Node(.js) - the premier JavaScript web server. Javascript run-time environment that executes javascript code outside of a browser (such as a server, machine).

In MERN stack, every line of code is written in JavaScript. This is a programming language that’s used everywhere, both for client-side code and server-side code. With one language across tiers, there’s no need for context switching.

For tech stack with multiple programming languages, developers have to figure out how to interface them together. With the JavaScript stack, developers only need to be proficient in JavaScript and JSON. Overall, using the MERN stack enables developers to build highly efficient web applications.

MERN is a full-stack architecture, following the traditional 3-tier architectural pattern, including the front-end display tier (React.js), application tier (Express.js and Node.js), and database tier (MongoDB). It allows an easy construction of  a 3-tier architecture (frontend, backend, database) entirely using JavaScript and JSON.

As shown on the illustration above, a user interacts with the ReactJS UI components at the application front-end residing in the browser. This frontend is served by the application backend residing in a server, through ExpressJS running on top of NodeJS.

Any interaction that causes a data change request is sent to the NodeJS based Express server, which grabs data from the MongoDB database if required, and returns the data to the frontend of the application, which is then presented to the user.

In order to complete this project you will need an AWS account and a virtual server with Ubuntu Server OS.

If you do not have an AWS account - go back to [WEB STACK IMPLEMENTATION](https://github.com/samuelbartels20/web-stack-implementation) Step 0 to sign in to AWS free tier account and create a new EC2 Instance of t2.nano family with Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS (HVM) image. Remember, you can have multiple EC2 instances, but make sure you **STOP** the ones you are not working with at the moment to save available free hours.

**Hint #1**: When you create your EC2 Instances, you can add Tag “Name” to it with a value that corresponds to a current project you are working on - it will be reflected in the name of the EC2 Instance. Like this:

[MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download.html) is an advanced multirotocol and multitool terminal for Windows.

Download and launch MobaxTerm, create a new SSH session with , ‘ubuntu’ as username and your private key (.pem file) like this:

To deploy a simple To-Do application that creates To-Do lists like this:

![](./images/mern.gif)

##  Backend configuration
Update ubuntu

```
sudo apt update
```
![](./images/ec2.png)

![](./images/update.png)

Upgrade ubuntu
```
sudo apt upgrade
```
![](./images/upgrade.png)

Lets get the location of Node.js software from [Ubuntu repositories](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions#deb).

```
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x | sudo -E bash -
```

### Install Node.js on the server
Install Node.js with the command below
```
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```
![](./images/node.png)

**Note**: The command above installs both <span style="color:red">nodejs</span>. and <span style="color:red">npm</span>. [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) is a package manager for Node like <span style="color:red">apt</span> for Ubuntu, it is used to install Node modules & packages and to manage dependency conflicts.

Verify the node installation with the command below
```
node -v 
```
![](./images/version.png)

Verify the node installation with the command below
```
npm -v 
```

### Application Code Setup
Create a new directory for your To-Do project:
```
$ mkdir Todo
```

Run the command below to verify that the <span style="color:red">Todo</span> directory is created with <span style="color:red">ls</span> command

**TIP**: In order to see some more useful information about files and directories, you can use following combination of keys <span style="color:red">ls -lih</span> - it will show you different properties and size in human readable format. You can learn more about different useful keys for <span style="color:red">ls </span> command with <span style="color:red">ls --help</span>.

Now change your current directory to the newly created one:
```
$ cd Todo
```

Next, you will use the command <span style="color:red"></span> to initialise your project, so that a new file named package.json will be created. This file will normally contain information about your application and the dependencies that it needs to run. Follow the prompts after running the command. You can press Enter several times to accept default values, then accept to write out the package.json file by typing yes.
